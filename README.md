# Kassini-mvp

## Technologies and Metadata
**Stack**: Java 17, Spring & Spring Boot

**Database**: MongoDB (Interaction was with Spring Data JPA)

**Author**: Bikathi Martin([Github](https://github.com/bikathi))

**Status**: Incomplete, Abandoned*

## About Kassini
Kassini started as a simple backend to build a real-time chat system from scratch using Spring and Web Sockets.
With time I built upon the code some of the complex social-media like features like:
- Following and being followed
- Liking and commenting
- Posting
- Basic accounting abilities
- User accounts
- e.t.c

## The Code Is Incomplete and Far From Perfect
I stopped development of the code when more urgent matters came up and have decided to open-source it for anyone to pick up and continue working on. Maybe it will be of some help to you.
I am placing it under an **Apache 2.0** license which has little to no restrictions to what you can do with the code.

## Is this a Social Media App?
No. It was designed as a business-business/ business-customer interaction app with social-media functionality. It's core purpose is to act as a business platform with a similar idea to things like:
- Jiji ([Jiji Kenya](https://jiji.co.ke/))
- Other systems that function like Jiji Kenya

## Will The Code Be Maintained
To some extent yes. I have abandoned the code but it is still part of my portfolio and as such I **may** from time to time push updates to it.

## Is There A UI or a UI Idea
Yes there was plans to make a web-based UI in VueJS but that was abandoned due to the previously mentioned **urgent matters**. That has seen very minimal development and barely is even a UI. The link to 
the UI can be found in my Github at: [Kassini MVP Web UI](https://github.com/bikathi/kassini-mvp-webui)
